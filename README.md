# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-Neural-Networks-
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a large custom dataset of over 107,000 images. Achieved 100% accuracy on an independent test set. Currently preparing for web application integration with Django.
